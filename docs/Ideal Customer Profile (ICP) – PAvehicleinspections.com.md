## Notes for Future Expansion

While this ICP focuses on individual end users, future versions should develop a secondary profile for:

- **Inspection station owners/operators**, especially when rolling out features for listing claims, business profiles, and paid promotion.

Edge cases such as re-inspections, title transfers, and inspections for resale may also provide opportunities for future content strategy.
